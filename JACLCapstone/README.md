## Story
In a vast kingdom named Jewel, there once lived a family secluded in the woods. In this family there was a mother, a father, an older brother, and a younger sister. The mother and father loved their children very much teaching them the ways of life as the children grew. The oldest brother was named Malc, short for Malachite, and he was always curious for knowledge. He would question his mother and father about everything in life and why the things were the way they are. The younger sister was named Dia, short for Diamond, and she was very loyal and followed her parents orders to a tee.

Whenever the parents would leave for the main village Prism for supplies they always brought back a new book for Malc to read and feed his thirst for knowledge. Dia on the other hand would rarely receive anything but was alright with it because she didn’t really require anything other than the love and support of her family.

One day, while the parents were out getting supplies, the siblings knocked over a vase sitting on a mantle shattering it into a thousand pieces. They were unsure of where the key went and decided to ask their parents upon their return from town.

The parents explained that the key they had uncovered was of vast importance and that it was a key to “unlock the gemstones”. The children were baffled and asked what theres “gemstones” were. The parents explained that long ago in the kingdom of Jewel there was a guardian made of many precious, beautiful, extravagant gems and held immense powers.

One day, there came to be an evil conqueror of lands named Onyx. Onyx’s plan was to take control of the kingdom of Jewel and make all of it’s people into slaves to make his army more powerful and to help conquer other lands. The guardian, trying to protect the kingdom and the people made it’s ultimate sacrifice during an epic battle with Onyx. The guardian sacrificed it’s own life by shattering into several pieces in order to permanently seal away Onyx in a black gemstone of his own.

The parents told Malc and Dia that their family were apart of a sacred lineage to protect pieces of the guardian, to ensure that Onyx should never escape his face, and to keep peace throughout Jewel. They were the Gemstone Guardians.

One day when Malc and Dia were playing by the mountainside an earthquake shook the entire kingdom. Scared from the boulders falling, the two guardians found safety from inside of a cave. A giant boulder came tumbling down the mountainside and trapped the two within it. The two guardians panicked because they were trapped when they saw a faint shimmering light glowing from across the cave. Malc and Dia walked closer while the glow became brighter and brighter. They got close and inspected the glowing rock and became entranced with it’s glow. Suddenly they could hear a faint voice creep inside their heads asking for help. Malc and Dia bewildered, asked how they could help. The glowing rock told them to push it and topple it down the cave’s ledge. The children did as the rock asked. The rock toppled down further into the cave until the sound of shattering glass occurred. The two could hear the maniacal scream of a man. He said his name was Xoyn and that because they freed him from the rock, he would free them from the cave.

The three traveled deep within the cave until they came across the faint glow of daylight. They had traversed the cave and were able to finally escape it’s trap. Upon leaving the cave, Xoyn revealed to the two that he was actually Onyx the evil conqueror and thanked them for helping him to escape his prison, and his gratitude was helping them leave the cave.

Onyx took off into the distance leaving the children dumbstruck and int err as they had just released a great evil upon the land. When they arrived home, they had found their home smashed by a boulder from the earthquake. The two found their parents stuck underneath the boulder. Sobbing uncontrollably, the parents tried to reassure their children that everything would be fine but the two had to stay strong. 

The children told the parents about how they released Onyx accidentally from his imprisonment. The mother said that their time has come and that they were needed as the guardians since both parents couldn’t move from the boulder. The father reached around his neck and gave Dia the key they had found previously that he had made into a necklace and told Malc to watch after her and to go find the chest that the key opens in Roughcut Village. The father explained that Inside the chest, there will be a ledger and it will explain everything you need to know about it’s contents and what to do. He told them to be off and save the kingdom of Jewel.

During the travel from their home to Roughcut Village, the two were ambushed by thieves and were running away from them. One of the thieves shot a bow at Dia and before it landed, Malc ran in front of her and took the shot like acting as her shield. She let out a giant scream alerting people nearby who came to their rescue. Upon seeing other villagers, the thieves ran away leaving Dia with her now injured brother. The brother told her that she must continue her quest and their parent’s wish to open the chest and save the kingdom. He told her that he would be fine and that the village doctor would take care of him for as long as he needed caring for.

Reluctantly, Dia took the key from Malc and searched the village for the chest. The village elder Jasper had the chest and explained to her that only gemstone guardians were allowed to open the chest. She revealed the key and explained to Jasper the dire situation. With a stomp of his foot, Jasper revealed a secret opening in the floor where the chest was and allowed Dia to open it.

Inside the chest, Dia found a mystical gem encrusted sword and a ledger. The ledger explained that in the case that Onyx was ever free from his imprisonment that the guardians would need to recover the mystical gems that were from the guardian and place them on the Gemstone Guardian Altar which was placed for it’s remembrance for saving the kingdom once before. The Jade gem would be found in the Emerald Temple. The Ruby gem would be found in Sanguine Crag. The Sapphire gem would be found in Azure Iceberg. Finally, the Topaz gem would be found in the Golden Spire. With these instructions at hand and the kingdom of Jewel on her shoulders, Dia left for her ultimate adventure and quest to save the land.
