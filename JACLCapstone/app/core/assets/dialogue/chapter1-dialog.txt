Sign: Dia! Quickly, head into the cave and take cover!<s><t>
Malc's Echo: Dia! Stay close and wait for this earthquake
to stop!<s>
Malc's Echo: Aggghhh, my arm, I don't think I can wield my 
sword in this cave. Dia can you take it and use it if we
need it?<s><t>
You've attained the Sword! Use [SPACE BAR] to swing it at your
foes!<s><t>
Malc's Echo: Whew, that earthquake was a close call! I hope 
mother and father are alright. This cave sure is dark, good 
thing I brought our lantern with us.<s><t>
Malc's Echo: It's no use, I this boulder won't budge.
Maybe we can find another way out of this cave.<s><t>
Mysterious Voice: Heeeeellllllppppppp Meeeeeeeeeeeee!<s>
Malc's Echo: Who... who's there!?<s>
Mysterious Voice: Heeeeeeeelllllpppppp meeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.....<s>

Malc: Well Dia, it looks like we have no choice, 
let's listen to the voice and get the heck out of here!<s><t>
Mysterious Voice: Thank you children for freeing me. My name is Xoyn.
I've been trapped in that crystal by an evil wizard from long ago.
As my gratitude for being free, I shall guide you out of the cave.<s>
Malc: It is our pleasure, normally we wouldn't trust a mysterious voice,
but we had no other choice. Thank you for guiding us out of here!<s><t>
Xoyn: Ahhhhhh the fresh air! The breeze! The sunlight! 
I haven't had these pleasantries in decades! **Evil Cackle**<s>
Thank you children, now that I am free from my confines, I, 
Onyx, shall continue trying to take over this treacherous
kingdom of Jewel!<s>
It took all the remaining strength I had to conjure up that little 
"earthquake" you two were so scared about in order to lure you
in and free the likes of me! **Evil Cackle** For your cooperation<s>
I have held up my deal and lead you outside of the cave and as
gratitude for setting me free, I shall let you live to see another day. 
Goodbye children, and thank you for letting my wickednes roam<s>
again! **Evil Cackle**<s><t>
Malc: Hey! Mister! Wait! What do you mean you're going to take over
Jewel! Xoyn!!!<s>
Dia, this is bad, we better go back home and tell mother and father 
what happened!<s><t>
Father: Dia! Malc! Thank the guradian you two are alright. Where did the
two of you go during the earthquake!?<s>
Malc: Papa, we ran into the cave in the forest for shelter.<s>
Father: Oh thank goodness! We were worred you two would've been 
crushed by the debris falling from the Sanguine Crag.<s>
Dia: Oh papa! I'm so sorry!<s>
Father: What happened Dia? You two are okay, everything is fine!<s>
Dia: Well, when Malc and I ran into the cave we got trapped inside. 
We heard a strange voice coming from a glowing crystal. 
The crystal told us to knock it over and it would help us escape<s>
so we did!<s>
Father: Oh Dia! Please don't tell me... you both found the crystal
imprisoning the evil conquerer Onyx?<s>
Dia: Yes, but how did you know!?<s>
Father: My dear children, gather around while your mother and I tell
you the story of how we came to live where we are and who our family 
really is.<s><t>
Father: Many many years ago, when I was but a wee child there was a 
beautiful guardian of our land of Jewel. It was made of extravagent 
gemstones that held mystical powers.<s>
It protected us from the dangers of the land, helped us live free 
and happy. But one day, an evil came onto our lands.
That evil's name was Onyx.<s>
Onyx had a plan to conquer the kingdom of Jewel and take control of
our very own gemstone guardian. An epic battle between
the guardian and Onyx took place and in the end the gemstone<s>
guardian shattered into several pieces sealing away Onyx into his 
own black gemstone. Since that day, our family was chosen by the 
village to protect the several shattered pieces in case one day<s>
we may need to try and summon the gemstone guardian once again.<s><t>
Onyx: Touching story old gemstone guardian, but you're too late.
I've already gathered and hidden those precious jewels across this
land. My power hasn't returned enough to destroy such mystical<s>
gems, but I have enough to at least take care of you!<s><t>
Father: Onyx! You will never get away with this!<s>
Onyx: *Evil Cackle* Hehehehe, oh, but I already have, and once
I regain my strength I shall gather those mystical gems and 
corrupt them to summon my own dark and evil gemstone guardian!<s><t>
Father: Dia go check on Malc to see okay. Luckily your mother 
and I were able to conjure up a bit of magic to protect ourselves;
however, we only have enough to keep this boulder from crushing<s>
us for the time being.<s><t>
Father: I see, so he's out cold? Well I'll need you to keep his 
sword and run to Prism City and grab the doctor, while you're
there try to also find the Minor brothers to help break up this<s>
boulder so we can get out from underneath. The city should be
located North! We only have so many resources here in Roughcut
Village but if you find anything useful, be sure to take it with<s>
you!<s><t>
Doctor: I see! Dia, I'll go ahead and hurry on down to your home,
I hope I get there in time to help Malc and the rest of your
family!<s><t>
Natural Minor: Dia, my brother's haven't returned from the fields
to the West! They're the only ones that can help remove that
boulder on your house. Can you go check on them to make sure<s>
they're alright? I would leave, but I have to mind the store,
thank you bunches!<s><t>
Sharp Minor: Thanks for helping us with those beasts Dia!
We were out for some supplies and didn't hear them come up
from behind us. Our hearing's gone a little bad from all the<s>
dynamite and mining we do from day to day. They ended up hurting
Flat, my little brother, over here and he ended up fainting
because he's not used to some pain. He'll be alright though,<s>
he's just overreacting. I'll go ahead and drag him back to our 
store. Meet us there and we can talk more about helping your 
parents.<s><t>
Sharp & Flat Minor: Thanks for the help back there. We'd be 
glad to help out your family. We'll leave right away and meet 
you there. Thanks Dia!<s><t>
Doctor: Dia, your family are all under fairly good condition.
Nothing too serious except for Malc's broken bones. Your 
parents were lucky they had just enough magic power to protect<s>
themselves from the attacks.<s><t>
Father: Dia, your mother and I are still weak from using too
much of our magic. Your brother, who is alright, has too many
broken bones to try and stop Onyx so it's up to you now to<s>
take on this quest to try and save Jewel! The first gemstone
we have hidden is in the Emerald Temple hidden to the East.
It's past the Overgrown Hollow and the Deadly Oasis.<s>
Hurry and reach the temple and reclaim the gemstone there
so we can try to reassemble the Gemstone Guardian in order
to stop Onyx and his dasterdly plans!
